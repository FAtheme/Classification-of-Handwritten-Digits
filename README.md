# Classification-of-Handwritten-Digits
This repository contains one of the projects Iâ€™ve completed for the Computational Data Mining course at Kharazmi University.

Here, I use CNN for Classification of Handwritten Digits. For building the Neural Network, I use the USPS Handwritten Digits Dataset.
