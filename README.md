# Classification-of-Handwritten-Digits
This repository contains one of the projects Iâ€™ve completed for the Computational Data Mining course at Kharazmi University.

Here, we use CNN for Classification of Handwritten Digits. For building our Neural Network, we will be using the USPS Handwritten Digits Dataset.
